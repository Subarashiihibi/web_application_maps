# Introduction to the Web_Application_Maps Repo
The repository practiced creating web applications using Mapbox GL JS APIs. Two maps relating the US COVID-19 Data in 2020 were generated.

# Functionality
The program applied the latest version of Mapbox GL JS to create two informative maps for audiences. The Choropleth Map could be interacted with the user if the user hover their mouse on the United States Counties. The COVID-19 Rate of the place where the user locate their mouse woule be shown by doing so. The Proportion map shows the counts of the counties and the scale of number of cases would be rather directly displayed on the map.
